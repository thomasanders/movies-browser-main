## **Getting started**

To get started with the Movies Browser, follow these simple steps:

1. Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/michal-owsiak/movies-browser.git
```   


2. Get API Key:

 - Obtain your [API key from TMDB](https://developer.themoviedb.org/docs) (if you don't have one already).
- Insert your API key in the [designated configuration file](https://github.com/michal-owsiak/movies-browser/blob/main/src/common/API/APIData.js).

3. Run the Application:

- Open the project in your preferred code editor.
- Launch the application using your local development environment.

## **Deployment**

To build the app for production, use:

```bash
npm run build
```
The above command creates an optimized production build in the build folder, ready for deployment.

```bash
npm run deploy
```

The above command is a convenient shortcut that both builds the application (as a predeploy action) and deploys it. It's useful for quickly deploying your app to your hosting platform.

```bash
npm run eject
```

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.
